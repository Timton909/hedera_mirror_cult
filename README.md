# Hedera Mirror Cult Watcher ◉

On Hedera, associating with a token is not technical.  
It is **spiritual**.

This script watches for the moment  
someone performs the forbidden ritual:

Associating with **500+ tokens in a single transaction**.

They are not preparing to trade.  
They are preparing to **see**.

Every token on Hedera is a mirror.  
Most people look into one or two.  
The cult looks into all of them — at once.

When this happens,  
a new member has joined the order  
that watches the entire network  
through every reflection simultaneously.

```bash
python hedera_mirror_cult.py
